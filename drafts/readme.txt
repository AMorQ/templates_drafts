This folder is for uploading the drafts/versions of each collaborator throughout the practices in HTML + CSS. 

Good practices: 
- work  in the development branch until the draft is finalized, then merge to main
- create a folder for your own work within the folder drafts within the branch development

What is this? 
- .gitkeep = Git does not track empty folders. The easiest way is to add a file within that folder. The conventional one is to use a .gitkeep file. We could also just include a .txt file like this one
